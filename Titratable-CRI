# Titratable CRI
# Here's what we need to get working for this to be viable
# Convert micrograms to milligrams and vice versa if needed (1mg = 1000 mcg)
# Convert minutes to hours and hours to minutes if needed (60 min = 1 hour (No shit))
# Variables we have to work with
    # The desired rate ((volume desired = drug weight desired/kilogram/time))
    # Desired dose of the drug in weight/time
    # Weight of patient
    # Volume of the CRI we want to use
    # Weight by volume of the drug
# Seems like that's it for now
# Simplify the variables once the final code is done, there's too much text. It gives the script more places to pop out errors 
    #We're gonna have multiple "if", "then", and "and" statements for the following combinations
    # Hours and mcg [CHECK]
    # Hours and mg [CHECK]
    # Minutes and mcg [CHECK]
    # Minutes and mg [CHECK]
